Create a single-page 3D visualization UI using HTML + JavaScript.

Purpose:
Visualize graph data served from a FastAPI backend (/graph and /summary endpoints).

Requirements:

1. Use:
   - 3d-force-graph (Three.js based)
   - Minimal inline CSS and JS (no build step)
   - Responsive full-screen canvas

2. Layout:
   - Main 3D scene filling viewport (`#scene`)
   - Right control panel (fixed top-right)
       • Mode selector (lineage / usage / domain)
       • Focus type selector + text input
       • Node size metric selector
       • Link strength slider
       • Buttons: Reload, Auto-Spin, Explain (summary)
   - Left legend (fixed top-left) showing color keys per node type
   - Bottom-left “Details” panel
       • Appears on node click
       • Shows node label, name, and properties
   - Bottom-right “Impact Summary” panel
       • Shows the /summary text response
       • Close button to hide

3. Functionality:
   - Fetch graph JSON from /graph based on current mode and focus.
   - Render with ForceGraph3D:
       • Node color based on label
       • Node size based on metric or degree
       • Link opacity 0.35, directional particles enabled
       • Smooth camera fly-to on node click
   - Click node → show details panel.
   - Click background → hide details.
   - Click “Explain” → fetch /summary and show in summary panel.
   - Toggle auto-spin (rotates camera slowly).
   - Update link strength and node size interactively.
   - Hard refresh loads default mode = lineage.

4. Include all HTML, CSS, and JS in one file (index.html).

Deliver a complete working `index.html` file ready to serve under `/static/` in FastAPI.
